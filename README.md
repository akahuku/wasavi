wasavi is an extension for Chrome, Opera and Firefox. wasavi transforms TEXTAREA element of any page into a VI editor, so you can edit the text in VI.  wasavi supports almost all VI commands and some ex commands.

wasavi is under development. Any bug report or feature request is welcome.

And we also welcome a donation to continue development:

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

## How to launch wasavi

Focus TEXTAREA and press `Ctrl+Enter`.

## How to quit wasavi

To quit wasavi press `ZZ` or `:q` or `:wq` or any other VI quit command.

## Which options are accepted by the `:set` command?

See [this table](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/wiki/All-Options-which-wasavi-recognizes).

Note: there are also options which are accepted but don't have any effect yet.

## How to modify initial settings:

Open preference wasavi extension (or enter `:options` on wasavi),
and edit "exrc" textbox.

## How to control beep

Add `set noerrorbells` to your exrc to disable beep sound.  If you prefer a visual bell, add `set visualbell` instead.

Also, a chime at wasavi startup can be disabled with `set nolaunchbell`.

The volume of any beeps can be controlled with `set bellvolume=N`.  Range of value N is 1 to 100.

## How to access local files

See [document](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/wiki/Local-access).

## How to use wasavi with Vimperator/Keysnail/VimFx on Firefox

### Vimperator

Put [wasavi_mediator.js](https://raw.github.com/akahuku/wasavi/master/src/mediators/vimperator/wasavi_mediator.js) in your Vimperator plugin directory, for example,  `~/.vimperator/plugin` or `%HOME%\vimperator\plugin`.

This plugin will control the pass-through mode of Vimperator according to the state of wasavi.

### Keysnail

Put [wasavi_mediator.ks.js](https://raw.github.com/akahuku/wasavi/master/src/mediators/keysnail/wasavi_mediator.ks.js) in your Keysnail plugin directory.

This plugin will control suspend mode of Keysnail according to the state of wasavi.

### VimFx

Latest VimFx recognizes wasavi as editable element.  While wasavi is running, VimFx suspends temporarily.

To use VimFx's key binding while wasavi is running, click outside area of wasavi or enter `:set esctoblur` and press `<esc>` in normal mode.  Then keyboard focus would be removed from wasavi, and you can use VimFx's key binding.

## How to use wasavi as an independent text editor

Install the wasavi extension and open the link to [wasavi online app](https://wasavi.appsweets.net). wasavi will start automatically. You can use ex commands `:read`, `:write`, `:edit` or `:file` to access your Dropbox/Google Drive/OneDrive files or local files. You will have to authorize wasavi via OAuth to access these storages.

## About automatic setting override

The `:set` commands which you input while wasavi is running are stored to extension's persistent storage, and those are regenerated when you launch wasavi next time.

This setting override mechanism works each independent URLs (max 30). If you think this is unnecessary, put `:set nooverride` in your exrc. Then overriding will be skipped.

## How to cooperate with Migemo

wasavi for Chrome can [Migemo](http://0xcc.net/migemo/) search.  Install [Migemo Server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/migemo-server-for-google/dfccgbheolnlopfmahkcjiefggclmadb), then input a special meta character `\M` in search query of `/` or `?` command.  If `\M` included in search query, these search commands are executed via migemo.

## I have noticed a bug

Please create an issue on [wasavi issue tracker](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/issues)

Tips and Tricks
===============

* to maximize the wasavi: `:set fullscreen` or `:set fs`
* to restore the wasavi: `:set nofullscreen` or `:set nofs`
* to change a color theme: `:set theme=blight` or `:set theme=charcoal` or `:set theme=matrix` or `:set theme=solarized` or `:set theme=solarized_dark`
* abbreviate syntax is
	+ `:abbreviate` displays all the abbreviations currently registered.
	+ `:abbreviate [clear]` clears all the abbreviations.
	+ `:abbreviate lhs` displays the abbreviation corresponding to lhs.
	+ `:abbreviate lhs rhs` registers a abbreviation which expands lhs to rhs.
	+ `:abbreviate [noremap] lhs rhs` also registers, but it is not effected remap mechanism.
* map syntax is
	+ `:map` displays all the mappings currently registered.
	+ `:map [clear]` clears all the mappings.
	+ `:map lhs rhs` registers a rule which translates lhs to rhs. Its translation is recursive. About syntax of key stroke descriptor like `<esc>` in the lhs and rhs, see [this page](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/wiki/Syntax-of-key-stroke-descriptor).
	+ `:map [noremap] lhs rhs` also registers, but it is non-recursive.
	+ `:map` targets the normal mode mappings. On the other hand,
	  `:map!` targets the insert mode. This is equivalent to vim's `:imap`.
	+ For more detailed information, see [Syntax of map command](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/wiki/Syntax-of-Map-command).
* `j` `k` `^` `$` moves cursor by physical row, on the other hand,
  `gj` `gk` `g^` `g$` moves by wrapped row. To swap the behavior: `:set jkdenotative`
* `f` `F` `t` `T` extension for Japanese: these commands recognizes reading (ro-ma ji
  expression) of hiragana, katakana, and kanji. For example, `fk` will place
  a cursor on 'か', 'カ', '漢' and so on.
* `f` `F` `t` `T` extension for Latin script: these commands recognizes the base alphabet
  of diacritical marked letter. For example, `fa` will place a cursor on
  'å', 'ä', 'à', 'â', 'ā' and so on. Also see [mapping table](https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi/wiki/Latin-1-alternative-presentation-in-f-F-t-T-command).
* use a online storage as file system:
	+ `:filesystem status` shows all file systems currently available.
	+ `:filesystem default` shows default file system. You can set default file system
	  via `:filesystem default dropbox` or `:filesystem default gdrive` or `:filesystem default onedrive`.
	+ `:filesystem reset` discards the access token for online storage.
	+ You can place the file system name at the head of a file name explicitly:
	  for instance, `:read dropbox:/hello.txt`.
* When you read from the register of A to Z, some registers returns special content:
	+ `B` register: user agent string
	+ `D` register: current date time string (formatted by using `datetime` option as template of strftime(3))
	+ `T` register: title string
	+ `U` register: URL string
	+ `W` register: version string of wasavi
* To return a setting to default state:
	+ `:set <option-name>&` or `:set <option-name>&default`
* To return all settings to default state:
	+ `:set all&` or `:set all&default`
* To return a setting to the state just after evaluation of exrc:
	+ `:set <option-name>&exrc`
* To return all settings to the state just after evaluation of exrc:
	+ `:set all&exrc`
* To submit a form automatically after writing text and closing wasavi:
	+ `:wqs`
	+ `:submit` (this can be shortened to `:sub` )
